# Execution Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: ‚ùå Workflow Connections Not Showing When Viewing from Executions Page

**Problem**: When clicking "View Workflow" from the Executions page, only nodes appeared - connections/edges were missing.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between how connections were saved vs. how they were loaded:
- **When Saving**: Connections were saved with React Flow node IDs (UUIDs like `"uuid-123"`)
- **When Loading**: Nodes were given IDs based on their names (like `"Webhook Trigger"`)
- **Result**: Connections couldn't find matching nodes because IDs didn't match

**Fix**: Updated the save logic to convert node IDs to node names before saving:

```typescript:apps/frontend/src/pages/WorkflowEditor.tsx
// Convert edges to backend format - map node IDs to node names
const backendConnections = edges.map(edge => {
  const sourceNode = nodes.find(n => n.id === edge.source);
  const targetNode = nodes.find(n => n.id === edge.target);
  return {
    source: sourceNode?.data?.label || sourceNode?.id || edge.source,
    target: targetNode?.data?.label || targetNode?.id || edge.target
  };
});
```

Also added `workflowId` to loaded nodes for webhook URL generation:

```typescript:apps/frontend/src/pages/WorkflowEditor.tsx
data: {
  ...cfg,
  label: n.name || cfg.label,
  parameters: params,
  credentialsId,
  workflowId: wf.id, // Add workflowId for webhook URLs
},
```

‚úÖ **Result**: Connections now persist correctly and show up when viewing workflows!

### Issue 2: ‚ùå Execution Failures - Hard to Debug

**Problem**: Executions were failing but users couldn't see detailed error messages to debug the issue.

**Root Causes** (Multiple):
1. Missing credentials
2. Invalid node parameters
3. Network errors
4. Node execution errors
5. Missing trigger nodes

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced Backend Error Logging

Added detailed error logging in the execution engine:

```typescript:apps/backend/src/engine/executeWorkflow.ts
catch (error: any) {
  console.error("‚ùå Execution failed:", error);
  console.error("Error stack:", error.stack);
  await prisma.execution.update({
    where: { id: executionId },
    data: {
      status: "FAILED",
      results: { 
        error: error.message,
        stack: error.stack,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      },
      finishedAt: new Date()
    }
  })
}
```

Added execution data logging:

```typescript:apps/backend/src/engine/executeWorkflow.ts
console.log("üìã Execution data:");
console.log(`  - Nodes: ${nodes.length}`);
console.log(`  - Connections: ${connections.length}`);
console.log("  - Nodes:", JSON.stringify(nodes, null, 2));
console.log("  - Connections:", JSON.stringify(connections, null, 2));
```

#### B. Created Execution Details Modal

New component to view detailed execution information:

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ View full execution details
- ‚úÖ See error messages with stack traces
- ‚úÖ View execution results (success or failure)
- ‚úÖ Common issues help section
- ‚úÖ Color-coded status indicators
- ‚úÖ Formatted JSON output

**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/components/ExecutionDetailsModal.tsx`

#### C. Integrated Details Button in Executions Page

Added "Details" button for each execution:

```typescript:apps/frontend/src/pages/Executions.tsx
<button
  className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300"
  onClick={() => setSelectedExecutionId(execution.id)}
  title="View execution details and results"
>
  Details
</button>
```

‚úÖ **Result**: Users can now see exactly why executions fail and how to fix them!

## How to Use the New Features

### 1. Viewing Workflow Connections

**Before**: Connections were lost when viewing workflows
**Now**: All connections are preserved

**Steps**:
1. Go to **Executions** page
2. Click **"View Workflow"** on any execution
3. ‚úÖ You'll see the complete workflow with all connections intact

### 2. Debugging Failed Executions

**Steps to Debug**:

1. **Go to Executions Page**:
   - Navigate to the "Executions" section in sidebar

2. **Find Failed Execution**:
   - Look for executions with red "FAILED" status badge

3. **Click "Details" Button**:
   - Opens a modal with comprehensive execution information

4. **Review Error Information**:
   - **Error Message**: Clear description of what went wrong
   - **Stack Trace**: Click "Show Stack Trace" for technical details
   - **Common Issues**: Helpful tips for common problems
   - **Results Data**: Full JSON output from execution

5. **Fix the Issue**:
   - Based on the error, update your workflow:
     - Add missing credentials
     - Fill in required parameters
     - Fix node configurations
     - Check API keys and tokens

6. **Re-execute**:
   - Go back to workflow editor
   - Make the fixes
   - Save and execute again

### 3. Common Execution Errors & Solutions

#### Error: "No trigger node found"
**Cause**: Workflow doesn't have a trigger node

**Solution**:
1. Open your workflow
2. Click the "+" button
3. Add a trigger node (Webhook, Manual, or Schedule)
4. Connect it to your action nodes
5. Save and execute

#### Error: "Missing credentials"
**Cause**: Node requires credentials but they're not configured

**Solution**:
1. Click on the node in workflow editor
2. In parameters panel, look for "Credentials" dropdown
3. Select or create credentials
4. Save the workflow
5. Try executing again

#### Error: "Required parameter not filled"
**Cause**: Node has required fields that are empty

**Solution**:
1. Click on the node
2. Fill in all required fields (marked with *)
3. Save the workflow
4. Execute again

#### Error: "Network error" / "API error"
**Cause**: External API is unreachable or returned an error

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check if the external service is operational
- Review rate limits (you might have exceeded them)

#### Error: "Invalid data format"
**Cause**: Data passed to node is in wrong format

**Solution**:
1. Review the execution details
2. Check the data format expected by the node
3. Use data transformation if needed
4. Verify JSON structure matches expected format

## Backend Console Output

When an execution runs, you'll now see detailed logs in the backend console:

```
üìã Execution data:
  - Nodes: 3
  - Connections: 2
  - Nodes: [
    {
      "name": "Webhook Trigger",
      "type": "webhook",
      "parameters": {},
      "position": [100, 100]
    },
    ...
  ]
  - Connections: [
    {
      "source": "Webhook Trigger",
      "target": "Send Message"
    },
    ...
  ]
```

If execution fails:
```
‚ùå Execution failed: Error message here
Error stack: Full stack trace...
```

    "status": "FAILED",
    "mode": "MANUAL",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-11T...",
    "finishedAt": "2025-10-11T...",
    "results": {
      "error": "Error message",
      "stack": "Stack trace...",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-11T..."
    },
    "workflow": {
      "id": "workflow-id",
      "title": "My Workflow"
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips for Debugging

### 1. Check Backend Console First
The backend logs show the most detailed information about what went wrong.

### 2. Use the Details Modal
The execution details modal shows all the information you need in a user-friendly format.

### 3. Common Patterns
- **FAILED immediately**: Usually missing credentials or invalid parameters
- **FAILED after delay**: Usually network/API errors
- **PENDING stuck**: Check if backend is running

### 4. Verify Workflow Structure
- Ensure workflow has a trigger node
- Verify all nodes are connected
- Check that all required parameters are filled

### 5. Test Incrementally
- Start with simple workflows
- Add nodes one at a time
- Test after each addition
- Easier to identify which node causes issues

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Workflow connections now persist when viewing from executions page
‚úÖ **Added**: Detailed execution details modal with error messages
‚úÖ **Improved**: Backend error logging for easier debugging
